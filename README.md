# How we approached this project
<h3> Step 1: Picking Dataset</h3>
We were given a five different datasets with the freedom to conduct our analysis on either one. We divide and conquer studying different datasets individually within a span of 3 days to look for the dataset we find the most interesting. We then came together and discuss our findings and unanimously settled for the Olist Market dataset from Kaggle.
<h3> Step 2: Data Exporation</h3>
In this step we created graphs, charts and even plotted on the map of Brazil of based on the amount of purchases made from the city. We did this step so as to better understand the data that we are handling and create a strong foundation of the dataset to tackle our problems we would later define.
<h3> Step 3: Problem Formulation </h3>
Based on all the data we have explored, we came together to generate 3 Data Problems.
